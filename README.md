# Vision
> All Mozillians (paid staff and contributors) have convenient and appropriate access to Mozilla services through a unified, authoritative, integrated identity system that empowers them to build a better Internet

# Summary
Mozilla’s Identity and Access Management (IAM) efforts improvements productivity of Mozillians (end-users and operational teams) by streamlining IAM management tasks while providing visibility.
Additionally, IAM provides an easier and significantly safer experience for the user and for services in need of authentication.

## About the GitHub organization setup
This organization has been created to hold IAM-related public repositories. These repositories are public.
This organization follows https://mana.mozilla.org/wiki/display/POLICIES/Standard%3A+GitHub+repositories+and+organizations
Access control needs to be tigher than on https://www.github.com/mozilla/ (main Mozilla GitHub organization) warranting it's separation.

## About this repository
This repository tracks all issues that do not have a GitHub repository assigned (such as non-code, code without repo, etc.)
